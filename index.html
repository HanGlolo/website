				This is the game we came up with.

			App Inventor.

			<p>
				For this project we were supposed to create an app that involved one of the DVC core values. Me and Michael decided to create a game where
				you can smack the people who do not the Da Vinci sports team.

			Bootstrap checkboard challenge.
		</h1>
			<a href="dvc_checkerboard.html"><img src="image/checkboard.PNG"width="843"height="442"/></a>
			<p>
				This was a quiz/challenge in which we had to use bootstrap to create a pink and purple checkboard. When coding the checkboard one of the mistakes I faced was that
				all the lines of my checkboard weren't parallel because I forgot to close all divs, I also noticed that using height instead of screenfill would help my checkboard to have an accurate shape.
				This quiz was a great example of why css is a more efficent way to style your code.

			<p> 
				Four our last project we had engineer an Arduino to do a certain thing. My partner and I coded and egineered an LCD board that was controlled by a potentiometer.
				we connected our board with a series of wires and a resistor. that way we were able to control the LCD. We also added code in order to make Arduino work. This was
				something we struggled with because we had code every pin of out arduino board to release a certain amount of electricity.
